# TVListingApplication
Spring MVC project with MySQL backend storage

The TV Listing Application is a Spring MVC project that has a MySQL back-end persistence store. 

You are able to perform CRUD operations to the Database via the web UI. 

I hope this helps anyone interested in creating an application of their own.
